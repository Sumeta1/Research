                        <i>Google Scholar</i> is a free academic search engine that indexes scholarly literature across various disciplines and formats. It provides access to peer-reviewed journal articles, scholarly books, conference papers, theses, dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports, court opinions, and patents.<br /><br />
                        
                        <i>Features and Functionality</i><br /><br />
                         
                        1. Search Capabilities: Google Scholar uses a web crawler to identify and index scholarly content. It prioritizes sources from academic domains like.edu and.gov, providing more relevant results for scholarly research compared to general web searches.<br />
                        2. Citation Analysis: It offers features like "Cited by" to view articles that have cited a specific publication, and "Related articles" to find closely related works. This allows researchers to track the impact of their work and explore related research.<br />
                        3. Citation Tools: Google Scholar provides citations in various academic styles (e.g., MLA, APA) and allows users to export bibliographic data to reference management software.<br />
                        4. Full-Text Access: While some results may require payment or institutional access, Google Scholar often links to freely available full-text versions of articles through open access repositories or institutional library subscriptions.<br />
